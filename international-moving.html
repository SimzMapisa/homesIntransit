                <h5>Global network of partners</h5>
                <p>Customs regulations vary from country to country. Our move coordinators will guide you through the
                    process. You will also be able to see a guide for customs clearance in your destination country on
                    our
                    website. We will be able to assist with all queries throughout your moving process.</p>
                <p>In the days leading up to your consignment arriving, the local agent will be in contact to ensure
                    that
                    everything is in order with the correct documentation in place. In some countries, you may be
                    required
                    to present documentation at the Customs office in that country upon arrival of your belongings.</p>
                <h5>How long does Customs clearance take?</h5>
                <p>International Customs clearance generally takes between one and two weeks for sea freight, however
                    air
                    freight is typically cleared between three to five working days. This is an estimate as customs
                    agents
                    may decide to check containers at random. If there are any duties to be paid, you move coordinator
                    will
                    keep you up to date.</p>
                <p>Once the Customs process has been completed, we are ready to make your delivery to your new property
                    or
                    storage location. It is important to note that this must be carried out within several days to avoid
                    any
                    demurrage charges.</p>
